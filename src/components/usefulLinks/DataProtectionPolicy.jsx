                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">We may share your information with third parties (e.g., airlines, hotels) to provide services. When acting as an agent, the service provider assumes responsibility for data security and legal compliance—not Rivaltrip.  </p>
                    <h3 className="text-[1.6rem] mb-[12px] font-semibold text-gray-500">8. International Data Transfers</h3>
                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">We may share your personal data within Rivaltrip.com, its local Travel Management Company (TMC) partners, and service providers when such international transfers are essential to fulfill a contract with you, your employer, or travel sponsor. This could involve moving your data beyond national borders, including outside regions like the European Economic Area (EEA). Many of our service providers operate outside these defined areas, necessitating data transfers for processing. To safeguard your personal data during these transfers, we apply at least one of the following protections:    </p>
                    <ul className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500 w-[90%] leading-6 mb-[12px] list-disc ml-[26px]">
                        <li>We transfer data only to countries recognized as offering sufficient data protection standards.   </li>
                        <li>When engaging specific service providers, we use tailored contracts to ensure your data receives protections equivalent to our own standards.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">Be aware that data sent to overseas recipients (outside our related entities) might land in jurisdictions where local data protection laws don’t match your own, potentially limiting your ability to seek remedies. Where permitted by your local laws, Rivaltrip.com isn’t responsible for how these recipients manage, store, or process your data.  </p>
                    <h3 className="text-[1.6rem] mb-[12px] font-semibold text-gray-500">9. Data Security</h3>
                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">We’ve implemented robust safeguards to protect your personal data from accidental loss, unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. Our security measures include:   </p>
                    <div className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500 mb-[12px]  leading-8 w-[90%]">
                        <p><strong>9.1. Site Access Control:</strong>We restrict unauthorized individuals from entering locations where data processing occurs.  </p>
                        <p><strong>9.2. System Access Control:</strong>We restrict unauthorized individuals from entering locations where data processing occurs.  </p>
                        <p><strong>9.3. Data Access Control:</strong>Authorized users are limited to accessing only the data they’re permitted to handle, ensuring it can’t be read, copied, changed, or deleted without approval during processing, use, or storage.   </p>
                        <p><strong>9.4. Disclosure Control:</strong>We verify and monitor where and to whom data is sent via transmission tools.   </p>
                        <p><strong>9.5. Input Control:</strong>We maintain logs to track who enters, modifies, or removes data from our systems, ensuring accountability.  </p>
                        <p><strong>9.6. Order Control:</strong>Data processed on behalf of customers is handled strictly according to their instructions.   </p>
                        <p><strong>9.7. Availability Control:</strong>We protect data from unintended destruction or loss.    </p>
                        <p><strong>9.8. Notification Control:</strong>In case of a significant breach of these measures, we notify affected customers promptly—within 72 hours of confirming a confidential data breach.  </p>

                    <h3 className="text-[1.6rem] mb-[12px] font-semibold text-gray-500">10. Data Retention</h3>
                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">We retain your personal data only as long as needed to meet the purposes for which it was gathered, such as fulfilling legal, accounting, or reporting obligations. To set retention periods, we evaluate the volume, type, and sensitivity of the data, the risks of unauthorized use or disclosure, the reasons for processing, and whether those goals can be met differently, alongside relevant legal standards. By law, we must hold onto basic customer details—like Contact, Identity, Financial, and Transaction Data—for six to seven years after you stop being a customer, depending on regional tax regulations. In some cases, you can request anonymization of your data after a period of inactivity with our services. </p>
                    <h3 className="text-[1.6rem] mb-[12px] font-semibold text-gray-500">11. Your Data</h3>
                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">Under specific conditions, data protection laws grant you rights over your personal data, including:   </p>
                    <ul className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500 w-[90%] leading-6 mb-[12px] list-disc ml-[26px]">
                        <li><strong>Access Request: </strong>You can ask for a copy of the personal data we hold (a “data subject access request”) to confirm we’re processing it lawfully.  </li>
                        <li><strong>Access Request: </strong>You may request updates to any incomplete or incorrect personal data we have, though we might need to verify the new information you supply.  </li>
                        <li><strong>Erasure Request: </strong>You can ask us to delete your personal data if there’s no valid reason for us to keep processing it—such as after successfully objecting to processing, if we’ve handled it unlawfully, or if local law mandates deletion. However, legal obligations might prevent us from complying, and we’ll inform you of any such reasons when you make the request.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500  leading-6 mb-[12px] w-[90%]">Note that restricting or halting our use of your data, or withdrawing prior consent, could hinder our ability to deliver services. For instance, travel bookings require full names, contact info, and ID (e.g., passport details)—without this, we can’t proceed with reservations.</p>
