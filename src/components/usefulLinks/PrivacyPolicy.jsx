This storage period may continue after our direct relationship with you ends, but only for as long as we need sufficient details to address potential future matters. For instance, we might retain data to process credits for a trip you booked but couldn’t take, to guard against fraud, to shield ourselves from liability, to enable us to seek remedies, reduce potential damages, or to comply with what we reasonably believe are legal, regulatory, or guideline mandates.

We are committed to honoring these rights and will respond swiftly, adhering to all applicable legal standards governing personal data processing. Below are your rights as outlined under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
                </p>
                <ul className="text-[0.9rem] text-gray-500 w-[90%] leading-6 mb-[12px] list-disc ml-[26px]">
                    <li><strong>Right to Understand Data Use:</strong> You can expect clear, concise, and accessible information about how we use and share your personal data, delivered in straightforward language for full transparency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Access Your Data:</strong> You may request confirmation of whether we process your personal data, gain access to it, and learn details about how we utilize it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Correct Errors:</strong> If your personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can ask us to update it. Should we have shared this data with third parties, we’ll make reasonable efforts to notify them of the corrections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Request Deletion:</strong> Known as the "right to be forgotten," you can ask us to erase certain personal data in specific situations. This isn’t an absolute right, and we’ll evaluate each request carefully in line with legal requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Limit Processing:</strong> You can restrict how we process your data in cases like disputing its accuracy, objecting to its use, or when processing is unlawful but you prefer restriction over deletion. This also applies if we no longer need the data, but you require it for legal claims.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> In some cases, you can request your personal data in a standard electronic format. This applies to data you’ve provided us (e.g., via forms) or data collected from monitoring your actions, but only if processing is based on consent or a contract and handled electronically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may challenge our processing of your data if it’s based on legitimate interests, public tasks (including profiling), direct marketing, or research/statistical purposes. We’ll inform you of this right during data collection, presenting it clearly and distinctly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right Against Automated Decisions:</strong> You’re protected from decisions made solely by automated means that significantly affect you legally or otherwise, unless you’ve agreed or it’s necessary for a contract.</li>

                    To exercise these rights, please send your request to support@telspace.us. There’s no fee to access your data or use these rights, though we may charge a reasonable amount for requests that are clearly baseless, repetitive, or excessive—or we may decline to act in such cases. For any questions or concerns about this Policy, feel free to contact support@telspace.us.
